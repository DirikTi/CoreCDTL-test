# CoreCDTL ‚Äì Core C Development Toolchain Library

**CoreCDTL** is a modular runtime and plugin framework built in C and C++, with an emphasis on low-latency execution, LLVM-powered JIT compilation, and event-driven communication.

CoreCDTL serves as the stable, low-latency **runtime core**. While the core can be initialized independently, its full utility, including **cross-language bridging** (via Coregen) and **external application connectivity** (via Ficus), is delivered by its companion projects.

---

## Key Features

- **Modular Plugin System** Load and manage C-based plugins dynamically. Each plugin can expose functions, interact with the runtime, and extend system capabilities.

- **Event Bus** A publish/subscribe mechanism enabling plugins to communicate asynchronously.

- **Scheduler** High-precision scheduler supporting interval and timeout tasks.

- **HeapKit** Memory and data management utilities, allowing plugins to manipulate and share structured state.

- **Gateway Module** Embedded communication layer using Unix sockets. Provides remote control via `corecdtl-ctl`, enabling plugins like **Ficus** to connect and exchange commands.

- **Bridge API** Expose and retrieve function pointers and metadata:
  ```c
  void *plugin_bridge_get_fn_ptr(const char *plugin_name, const char *fn_name);
  char* corecdtl_api_version(void);
  char* corecdtl_abi_version(void);
  int corecdtl_init(void);

(Additional integration details are provided in the **[Coregen project](https://github.com/CoreCDTL/coregen) ‚Üó**.)
